## Installation
Clone in your repo push_swap.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsannie/push_swap_tester.git
```

## Usage
Execute with ``./push_stats.sh`` and enter the size of the interval and the number of execution. 

Push-Stats will then calculate the total average of your moves on all the test. But also the minimum and maximum test.

The min and max of the test will be found in the ``results.txt`` file.

### Tips : 
You can also enter ``-1`` at the requested size to test automatically for ``3`` - ``5`` - ``100`` - ``500`` with your requested number of executions
